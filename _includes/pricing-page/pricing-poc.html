      <p class="subtitle">
        With dozens of language templates, access to private NPM, maven, gradle, Nuget and Go code repositories from faas-cli, you'll be able to ship code in a short period of time with the languages you already use.

        <h2 class="subtitle is-4">The reliability your customers need</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          OpenFaaS Standard with JetStream brings at least once semantics and a highly scalable queue with built in metrics showing the amount of work left to process. Failed requests can be retried, and additional named queues can be added as you grow.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container is-10 mb-4">
        <h2 class="subtitle is-4">Highly scalable</h2>
        <p class="subtitle mb-2">
          Kubernetes uses a generic autoscaler that was never built to scale functions. OpenFaaS Pro scaling can be fine-tuned to any workload. You can pick from Requests Per Second (RPS), CPU usage or Capacity (the amount of connections). Capacity mode scales slow running functions and ETL workloads which neither the Community Edition or Kubernetes can.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
            Just as important as scaling up, scaling down to zero keeps costs low whilst retaining the benefits.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container is-10 mb-4">
        <h2 class="subtitle is-4">Compliance matters</h2>
        <p class="subtitle mb-2">
            OpenFaaS Standard supports Istio and Linkerd for mutual TLS encryption between functions. OpenFaaS for Enterprises includes Single-Sign On, auditing and Role Based Access Control (RBAC).
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle">
            Pro's integration with ArgoCD, FluxCD through Custom Resources Definitions (CRDs) means that you can audit deployments through git, and make SOC2 compliance easier to achieve.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="container is-10 mb-4">
        <h2 class="subtitle is-4">Find problems before they find you</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">
          OpenFaaS Pro comes with Grafana dashboards showing you everything that could go wrong with a function, from errors due to timeouts, increasing latency, spikes in CPU and memory leaks. You'll be able to fix these issues before your customers even see them.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="container is-10">
        <h2 class="subtitle is-4">Collaborate and contribute</h2>
        <h3 class="subtitle">
          In the Customer Community, you'll get early access to new features and be able to leave feedback and suggestions for things that would make OpenFaaS better for your team. Rest assured that with OpenFaaS For Enterprises, you get an SLA and direct access to our engineering team via Slack.

OpenFaaS struck the perfect balance. It combines dynamic elasticity, intuitive function packaging, a robust API and comprehensive metrics. With secure namespace isolation for managing multi-tenant environments, OpenFaaS has proven to be a perfect fit for our needs.”
