Last August I wrote [a post](/blog/deploy-digitalocean-ansible.md) showing how you could set up OpenFaaS on DigitalOcean with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm in 5 minutes. This week saw the culmination of a collaboration between DigitalOcean and the OpenFaaS community, which resulted in the general availability of an OpenFaaS one-click Droplet image. This makes it even easier to deploy OpenFaaS in the most cost-effective way with DigitalOcean.

We now have three well-documented ways to setup OpenFaaS for your team on DigitalOcean's infrastructure:

* [Deploy OpenFaaS to DigitalOcean's Kubernetes Service (DOKS)](https://blog.alexellis.io/digitalocean-kubernetes-engine/)
* [Deploy OpenFaaS with Ansible with Kubernetes or Swarm](/blog/deploy-digitalocean-ansible.md)
* Use the new one-click Droplet image available today (this post)

In this post we'll guide you through creating your first OpenFaaS function using the one-click Droplet image which uses a single-node Docker Swarm cluster.

### Pre-requisites

* A DigitalOcean account

You will need to use your [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) account. If you're a new user then you can get credits of $100 over 60 days using this [referral link](https://m.do.co/c/2962aa9e56a1). This is a generous amount of credit with the most economic Droplet size being just $5 a month.

* The OpenFaaS CLI

The OpenFaaS CLI (or `faas-cli`) is now a core piece of the OpenFaaS developer-experience and our users run it locally and in their CI jobs. We'll use it to create and deploy our function onto your one-click Droplet. The OpenFaaS docs provide all the detail you need to [get the CLI](https://docs.openfaas.com/cli/install/).

### Create the Droplet

[Log in](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login) to your DigitalOcean account and head over to the create button, which details the products currently being offered by DigitalOcean. The one-click apps reside under Droplets.

![Create button menu](/images/digitalocean-one-click/create-button.png)

On the resulting menu select the one-click apps option which will present a number of one-click apps.

![Droplet menu](/images/digitalocean-one-click/droplet-menu.png)

We'll choose the one labelled OpenFaaS on 18.04. This will create a Swarm-based single node OpenFaaS instance on Ubuntu 18.04.

![OpenFaaS one-click](/images/digitalocean-one-click/openfaas-oneclick.jpg)

From here choose a Droplet size and region. You can run OpenFaaS on the cheapest node available for just 5 USD per month, but for the best experience and some future proofing I'd recommend `4 GB / 2 CPUs / 80 GB SSD`. I tend to pick the region closest to me - being in the UK this is London. Finally, choose your SSH key - if you need to generate and add a new key then please follow the [instructions on the previous blog](/blog/deploy-digitalocean-ansible/#create-and-upload-an-ssh-key). With your chosen configuration click Create.

![Click create](/images/digitalocean-one-click/create-droplet.png)

### Access your Droplet

Once your Droplet is ready it will appear in your list of Droplets within the DigitalOcean resources pane.

![Droplet is ready](/images/digitalocean-one-click/droplet-ready.png)

Copy the IP address and using your favourite terminal log in to the Droplet using `root@<IP address>`

> Note: ensure you have made the appropriate private key available to the client you are using.

Once logged in follow the instructions; at the time of writing this is simply to press Enter.

![Logged in](/images/digitalocean-one-click/terminal.gif)

A number of configuration actions will be performed for you, and the result will be a running Swarm-based OpenFaaS instance. Make a note of the credentials - in particular the final line which will set our credentials in the `faas-cli` - we'll need this when we deploy our function. We can now close the connection to the Droplet.

* On your local machine set the `OPENFAAS_URL`:

```sh
$ export OPENFAAS_URL=http://159.65.92.17:8080
```
> To persist this setting add it to your `.bashrc` file or `.bash_profile`.


* Run the CLI login command:

```sh
echo -n 6acf4e5dc4997530666fece7be3e15e5a1b7ba9572163aa2beb8ff9449ee1911 | faas-cli login --username=admin --password-stdin
```

These will save us time and effort when we come to deploy our function to the Droplet.

### Create a function

We're going to create a simple Python function that when invoked echoes back a string.

* Create a workspace for our function:

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/openfaas/functions/ && cd ~/openfaas/functions/
```

* Create a function called `hello-digitalocean` using the CLI:

> Replace the `rgee0` prefix with your own Docker hub account name so as to enable the ensuing `push` action.

```sh
$ faas-cli new --lang=python3 --prefix=rgee0 hello-digitalocean

faas-cli new --lang=python3 --prefix=rgee0 hello-digitalocean

Function created in folder: hello-digitalocean
Stack file written: hello-digitalocean.yml
```

* Rename `hello-digitalocean.yml` to `stack.yml`:

```sh
$ mv hello-digitalocean.yml stack.yml
```

* Edit `hello-digitalocean/handler.py` to add our function's code:

```python
def handle(req):
    """handle a request to the function
    Args:
        req (str): request body
    """
    return 'Hello from OpenFaaS on DigitalOcean!'
```

* Save the handler and run `faas-cli up` to build, push and deploy:

```sh
$ faas-cli up

```
> As we earlier logged the CLI in to our Droplet and also set the `OPENFAAS_URL`, the CLI will seamlessly target the Droplet. In order to push to Docker hub you will also need to be logged in to your account there.

* Invoke the function using the `faas-cli`:

```sh
$ echo '' | faas-cli invoke hello-digitalocean
Hello from OpenFaaS on DigitalOcean!
```

Access the UI to see the deployed function by visiting `http://159.65.92.17:8080/ui/`. You'll need the credentials from earlier in order to access the site.

![View the UI](/images/digitalocean-one-click/ui.png)

From here you can also invoke the function - simply click on the invoke button; you'll notice the invocation count increase as you do. You can also deploy from a set of ready-made functions via the OpenFaaS store - Click on `Deploy New Function` to see what's available.

## Wrapping up

We've taken our first steps into creating a function using DigitalOcean's OpenFaaS one-click application. The in-built configuration created a Docker Swarm based publicly accessible instance with basic authentication enabled by default. We've looked at how the OpenFaaS CLI can be used to build our functions and deploy them to a remote instance by setting the `OPENFAAS_URL`.

This is great as a starting point to quickly getting hands on with OpenFaaS. With an instance up and running you are ideally placed to work through the [OpenFaaS Workshop](https://github.com/openfaas/workshop). If you've followed this article fully then you should be able to skip straight on to [Lab 2](https://github.com/openfaas/workshop/blob/master/lab2.md) - remember to substitute any workshop references to `127.0.0.1` with the IP address of your Droplet.

### Keep learning

Taking it further we could look at how to configure a domain name to point at the instance and enable transit encryption through use of a service like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
