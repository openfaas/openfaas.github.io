How to run OpenFaaS on AWS Fargate with economical, auto-scaling containers. A low friction AWS
native deployment using VPCs, ECS, security groups, ALBs, AWS Secrets Manager and AWS Route 53 for
DNS, load-balancing and service discovery.

Experience required:

* Basic-level OpenFaaS
* Intermediate-level AWS

This article will explain why I've chosen to run OpenFaaS on AWS Fargate. We then move on to explore
how to deploy a fully working environment and run our first function.

For me, one of the best things about OpenFaaS is how portable it is. You can run OpenFaaS out of the box using 
officially supported platforms like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm . The [community](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/community.md) 
has added many other platforms, that allow you to run OpenFaaS in more places. A good example of this is deploying OpenFaaS
on Hashicorp's [nomad](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/functions-as-a-service-with-nomad) application scheduler.

### Why use AWS Fargate?
Your reasons for choosing AWS Fargate are likely to vary depending on your
experience, knowledge and goals. At [form3](https://form3.tech) we use AWS ECS to schedule Docker containers. 
We decided to build an OpenFaaS provider to run on ECS so we could leverage all of our existing knowledge and infrastructure code. 
Perhaps you too work in a team that uses AWS ECS? You may also work in a company that hasn't adopted Kubernetes and doesn't plan to in the immediate 
future. So if you fit that in that camp, how do you leverage the advantage of serverless computing? A good choice would
be to look at a managed serverless platform like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). In this article we examine 
another option, running OpenFaaS on Fargate, which I believe gives you some of the benefits of a managed service like 
Lambda with the flexibility of an open-source serverless platform like OpenFaaS.

## Architecture
OpenFaaS functions are built as Docker images and deployed as Docker containers. This approach may be very familiar to
developers using microservices. The platform is composed of `gateway`, `provider` and `monitoring` components. The 
gateway delegates the deployment and invoking of functions to the `provider`. The provider in our case is `faas-fargate`,
which has been specifically designed to run and invoke functions using AWS Fargate containers.

The diagram below shows how each of these components interact:

![openfaas-fargate](/images/openfaas-on-fargate/openfaas-fargate-component-architecture.png)

Each of the components are created and deployed as Fargate containers.

### Architecture features:

* **\[networking\]** we restrict traffic between containers using [AWS security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html)
* **\[networking\]** ingress traffic from the Internet is terminated in a `public subnet`. Container workloads are 
scheduled in a `private subnet` that has no access to the Internet
* **\[discovery\]** all workloads use [Amazon Route 53 auto naming](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/overview-service-discovery.html)
to manage service registration / de-registration
* **\[logging\]** we configure each container workload to log to [AWS cloudwatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).
* **\[secrets\]** managed using [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) and assigned access to functions
in the `stack.yaml`
* **\[tls\]** ingress TLS is automatically provisioned using [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) and the
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate authority.

## Run OpenFaaS on Fargate

The easiest way to run [OpenFaaS on Fargate](https://github.com/ewilde/faas-fargate) is to use the 
[terraform module](https://github.com/ewilde/terraform-aws-openfaas-fargate) I developed to deploy all the necessary components:

 * [OpenFaaS gateway](https://github.com/openfaas/faas)
 * [FaaS-Fargate provider](https://github.com/ewilde/faas-fargate) 
 * [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)
 * [Prometheus alert manager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager)
 * [NATS messaging server](https://github.com/nats-io/gnatsd)

Simply run the following commands:

> Disclaimer: as you would expect creating resources in AWS will incur charges. Please follow the tear-down instructions
below when you have finished.

### Configuration options explained


| Name                | Description                                                                                                                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| acme_enabled        | (Recommended)`1` to use the official [acme](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/acme/index.html) terraform provider to create TLS certificates. Defaults to `0`                       |
| acme_email_address  | (Recommended) Email address used to register TLS account, used in conjunction with `acme_enabled`                                  |
| aws_region          | (Required) The aws region to create the openfaas ecs cluster in                                                                  |
| alb_logs_bucket     | (Required) S3 bucket to store alb logs                                                                                           |
| debug               | (Optional) `1` to create an ec2 bastion in the external subnet and a test instance in the internal subnet. Defaults to `0`       |
| developer_ip        | your IP address, used to whitelist incoming SSH to the bastion, debug is enabled                                                 |
| route53_zone_name   | (Recommended) a Route 53 zone to create DNS records for the OpenFaaS gateway, i.e. openfaas.example.com, requires `acme_enabled` |
| self_signed_enabled | (Not recommended) Use a self-signed TLS certificate for the OpenFaaS gateway if not using `acme_enabled`. Defaults to `0`        |



Once terraform has finished creating the resources you should see success message, which looks similar to:
```shell
Apply complete! Resources: 133 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

alb_uri = openfaas-1918537172.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com
bastion_ip = []
login = echo -n "t6UbsFKnjgtv4KLF3Uw5llN6fyONE6nV" | faas-cli login --gateway https://openfaas-1918537172.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com --username=admin --password-stdin --tls-no-verify
login_secure = echo -n "t6UbsFKnjgtv4KLF3Uw5llN6fyONE6nV" | faas-cli login --gateway https://gateway.openfaas.12factor.io --username=admin --password-stdin
openfass_uri = https://gateway.openfaas.12factor.io/ui/
service_security_group = sg-0ff75545f2d542c4e
servicebox_ip = []
```

### Verifying the installation
When the gateway is running you can start deploying and running functions. 
You can tell if it's ready by calling the `healthz` endpoint and waiting for a `200` http status code

```shell
$ curl https://openfaas.{your-domain}.com/healthz -i

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 0
Date: Sat, 22 Dec 2018 10:39:17 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
```

You can also see the services running in the ECS console:

```shell

$ aws ecs list-services  --cluster openfaas
{
    "serviceArns": [
        "arn:aws:ecs:eu-west-1:122668425727:service/gateway",
        "arn:aws:ecs:eu-west-1:122668425727:service/prometheus",
        "arn:aws:ecs:eu-west-1:122668425727:service/nats",
        "arn:aws:ecs:eu-west-1:122668425727:service/alertmanager"
    ]
}
```

## Deploying a function
We can deploy functions to AWS Fargate the same way we would with another other OpenFaaS provider, through the CLI, UI or REST API.

Let's configure the `faas-cli` to point at our OpenFaaS cluster:

```shell
export OPENFAAS_URL=https://openfaas.{your-domain}.com
```

1\. Lets create and deploy a function to our new stack using the CLI:

```shell
$ faas new hello-world --lang go -p ewilde

2018/12/22 10:29:03 No templates found in current directory.
2018/12/22 10:29:03 Attempting to expand templates from https://github.com/openfaas/templates.git
2018/12/22 10:29:05 Fetched 14 template(s) : [csharp dockerfile go go-armhf java8 node node-arm64 node-armhf php7 python python-armhf python3 python3-armhf ruby] from https://github.com/openfaas/templates.git
Folder: hello-world created.
  ___                   _____           ____
 / _ \ _ __   ___ _ __ |  ___|_ _  __ _/ ___|
| | | | '_ \ / _ \ '_ \| |_ / _` |/ _` \___ \
| |_| | |_) |  __/ | | |  _| (_| | (_| |___) |
 \___/| .__/ \___|_| |_|_|  \__,_|\__,_|____/
      |_|


Function created in folder: hello-world
Stack file written: hello-world.yml
```
In the command above `--prefix` corresponds to my username on the Docker Hub. 
The function will be built into a Docker image and then pushed there through the `faas-cli up` command. 
You can also use your own self-hosted registry.

2\. Open `./hello-world/handler.go` to see the function entry point

```golang
package function

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Handle a serverless request
func Handle(req []byte) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("Hello, Go. You said: %s", string(req))
}
```

3\. Now let's build and deploy the function to our new environment
```shell
$ faas up -f hello-world.yml

... <- lots of lovely build output from Docker

Deploying: hello-world.

Deployed. 202 Accepted.
URL: https://openfaas.{your-domain}.com/function/hello-world
```

### Removing the installation
* Firstly, remove any functions that you have deployed using `faas-cli remove FUNCTION_NAME`
* Run `make destroy`. This can take between 5-10 minutes. The `destroy` target calls `terraform destroy`. 

> The `terraform destroy` command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure.

```shell
$ make destroy

... <--- lots of destroying going on here

aws_subnet.external[2]: Destruction complete after 1m48s
aws_security_group.alb: Still destroying... (ID: sg-0a84a6bd951bacb6d, 1m50s elapsed)
aws_security_group.alb: Destruction complete after 1m51s
aws_vpc.default: Destroying... (ID: vpc-0220284dd7ba01f58)
aws_vpc.default: Destruction complete after 0s

Destroy complete! Resources: 133 destroyed.
```

## Wrapping up

We've seen how the OpenFaaS provider architecture makes it easy to extend the platform and 
run serverless functions on AWS Fargate. Then we deployed a complete OpenFaaS stack using terraform 
on to AWS Fargate and secured the transport layer using the ACME provider and Let's Encrypt. 

My code:

- [faas-fargate](https://github.com/ewilde/faas-fargate): OpenFaaS provider for AWS Fargate
- [Terraform installer for faas-fargate](https://github.com/ewilde/terraform-aws-openfaas-fargate): Installs the 
OpenFaaS platform for AWS Fargate using Terraform

### What's next for faas-fargate

* Support _scale to zero_ using the [faas-idler](https://github.com/openfaas-incubator/faas-idler).
* Provide better _observability_ for users and integrate Grafana with the standard deployment to surface function metrics.
