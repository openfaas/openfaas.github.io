Meet the members of the OpenFaaS community at KubeCon North America, held in San Diego this November 2019. Hear talks on OpenFaaS from users and the Founder.

Whether you're going to be at KubeCon, or fighting off a case of "Fear of Missing Out" (fomo), we've got some great resources for you to get connected and to feel part of the excitement.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As KubeCon ðŸŒ® approaches, we wanted to give a shout-out from OpenFaaS to our awesome homepage and <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a> sponsors.<br><br>Thank you for helping us make a great platform for teams to build and run their microservices, Docker containers, and functions. ðŸ‘‘<a href="https://t.co/W1D8VciZJ6">https://t.co/W1D8VciZJ6</a> <a href="https://t.co/fStC65zDxt">pic.twitter.com/fStC65zDxt</a></p>&mdash; OpenFaaS (@openfaas) <a href="https://twitter.com/openfaas/status/1194909675554299905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

> You can find out how individuals can become Sponsors of the work of OpenFaaS, and how companies can associate their brand with the most popular Open Source Serverless project on the [CNCF Landscape](https://l.cncf.io).

## Catch a talk

It'd be great to see you attend one or more of our sessions over the course of the week, where you will have a chance to meet me in person and to hear what kind of problems companies are solving with OpenFaaS. I'll of course have swag, whilst stocks last.

### Case-study - OpenFaaS Ltd & DX, Norway with OpenFaaS cloud

[DX](https://dx.no/), who are also a Platinum homepage sponsor are one of the leading companies for point of sale (POS) solutions for Cinemas and venues all across Norway. Here are a few words from DX co-founder, [Christian Sakshaug](https://github.com/csakshaug):

> With help from OpenFaaS Ltd, we have been able to move forward faster with the transformation of our platform adopting both AWS and Kubernetes with EKS. It has been a brilliant experience, how we can both "lift and shift" legacy code and incrementally migrate our microservices too using the "strangler pattern". The ease of use and focus on developer-community has meant we can be part of the development process of OpenFaaS Cloud. 

> With OpenFaaS cloud we have started to migrate both our legacy PHP applications by adding Dockerfiles and our newer .NET 3.0 microservices which we deployed to AWS EKS. We also funded the development of AWS ECR support for OpenFaaS Cloud and are proud to be able to give back to the community wherever possible, such as through our Platinum homepage sponsorship.

## Couldn't make it? How about Amsterdam?

If you couldn't make KubeCon this year, it's understandable, especially for those who are travelling from Europe or who have used up their budget for this year. How about Amsterdam in March 30 â€“ April 2, 2020?

We're looking for end-users who are using OpenFaaS or OpenFaaS Cloud in some way who would like to talk about it. I'd personally be happy to help you prepare a talk abstract and potentially be a co-speaker with you at the event also.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let us know if you would like to submit a talk together to KubeCon Amsterdam which is happening in March 2020.<a href="https://twitter.com/alexellisuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@alexellisuk</a> would be happy to help you prepare, submit, and deliver the talk. <a href="https://t.co/BAvNFqsDaA">https://t.co/BAvNFqsDaA</a></p>&mdash; OpenFaaS (@openfaas) <a href="https://twitter.com/openfaas/status/1194613141432352768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

### Get involved

Whether you're attending KubeCon, or expecting some "fomo", there's no need to miss out, you can join the OpenFaaS Slack Community and get involved right away.

The OpenFaaS community values are: developers-first, operational simplicity, and community-centric.

* [Join us on OpenFaaS Slack](https://docs.openfaas.com/community/)
* [Find out how to contribute](https://docs.openfaas.com/contributing/get-started/)
* Try deploying your own free endpoints on the free [OpenFaaS Cloud, Community Cluster](https://docs.openfaas.com/openfaas-cloud/user-guide/)

If contributing code, docs, and community support isn't something you have time for, you can still make a difference as an individual. Help me reach 200 GitHub Sponsors by 1st Jan 2020 - [funds from GitHub Sponsors contribute towards my time](https://insiders.openfaas.io/) spent maintaining and building features, and giving technical support to the community.
