Meet the members of the OpenFaaS community at KubeCon North America, held in San Diego this November 2019. Hear talks on OpenFaaS from users and the Founder.

Whether you're going to be at KubeCon, or fighting off a case of "Fear of Missing Out" (fomo), we've got some great resources for you to get connected and to feel part of the excitement.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As KubeCon üåÆ approaches, we wanted to give a shout-out from OpenFaaS to our awesome homepage and <a href="https://twitter.com/github?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@github</a> sponsors.<br><br>Thank you for helping us make a great platform for teams to build and run their microservices, Docker containers, and functions. üëë<a href="https://t.co/W1D8VciZJ6">https://t.co/W1D8VciZJ6</a> <a href="https://t.co/fStC65zDxt">pic.twitter.com/fStC65zDxt</a></p>&mdash; OpenFaaS (@openfaas) <a href="https://twitter.com/openfaas/status/1194909675554299905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

> You can find out how individuals can become Sponsors of the work of OpenFaaS, and how companies can associate their brand with the most popular Open Source Serverless project on the [CNCF Landscape](https://l.cncf.io).

## Catch a talk

It'd be great to see you attend one or more of our sessions over the course of the week, where you will have a chance to meet me in person and to hear what kind of problems companies are solving with OpenFaaS. I'll of course have swag, whilst stocks last.

There's also a talk from [Ed Wilde](https://twitter.com/ewilde), from an OpenFaaS end-user company (Form3): [How we moved from JIRA to GitHub for fun and profit using Serverless @ Goto, Copenhagen, Denmark](https://gotocph.com/2019/sessions/1016)

It's great to see so many talks from the project being given over the course of a week.

[Stefan Prodan](https://twitter.com/stefanprodan/), from the OpenFaaS community is also going to be giving two talks on [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux). The Flux project was built as [Weaveworks](https://weave.works)' take on continuous-deployment for Kubernetes, and has since become a CNCF Sandbox project.

Here are Stefan's two sessions: [Intro to Flux](https://kccncna19.sched.com/event/Uai2/intro-flux-stefan-prodan-weaveworks-alexis-richardson-weaveworks?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) and then [Flux Deep Dive](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/schedule/).

If you don't get into town early enough to catch my talk at [Cloud Native Rejekts](https://cloud-native.rejekts.io), you can find out more about the conference on the [Google Kubernetes Podcast #79 with with Chris K√ºhl](https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/079-cloud-native-rejekts/), the founder of the event.

Are you looking for something different? Feel free to reach out to see if OpenFaaS Ltd can be of help.

#### Case-study with OpenFaaS Ltd professional services

This case-study is about [OpenFaaS Cloud](https://github.com/openfaas/openfaas-cloud) ("Multi-user PaaS for Kubernetes managed through git")

[DX](https://dx.no/) is both an OpenFaaS Ltd client and a Platinum homepage sponsor. They are one of the leading companies for point of sale (POS) solutions for Cinemas and venues all across Norway. Here are a few words from DX co-founder, [Christian Sakshaug](https://github.com/csakshaug) and the experience so far:

> With help from OpenFaaS Ltd, we have been able to move forward faster with the transformation of our platform adopting both AWS and Kubernetes with EKS. It has been a brilliant experience, how we can both "lift and shift" legacy code and incrementally migrate our microservices too using the "strangler pattern". The ease of use and focus on developer-community has meant we can be part of the development process of OpenFaaS Cloud. 

> With OpenFaaS cloud we have started to migrate both our legacy PHP applications by adding Dockerfiles and our newer .NET 3.0 microservices which we deployed to AWS EKS. We also funded the development of AWS ECR support for OpenFaaS Cloud and are proud to be able to give back to the community wherever possible, such as through our Platinum homepage sponsorship.

If you'd like to know more, you'll find Christian on Slack or you can ask me at KubeCon.

## Couldn't make it to San Diego? How about Amsterdam?

If you couldn't make KubeCon this year, it's understandable, especially for those who are travelling from Europe or who have used up their budget already. How about Amsterdam in March 30 ‚Äì April 2, 2020?

We're looking for end-users who are using OpenFaaS or OpenFaaS Cloud in some way who would like to talk about it. I'd personally be happy to help you prepare a talk abstract and potentially be a co-speaker with you at the event also.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let us know if you would like to submit a talk together to KubeCon Amsterdam which is happening in March 2020.<a href="https://twitter.com/alexellisuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@alexellisuk</a> would be happy to help you prepare, submit, and deliver the talk. <a href="https://t.co/BAvNFqsDaA">https://t.co/BAvNFqsDaA</a></p>&mdash; OpenFaaS (@openfaas) <a href="https://twitter.com/openfaas/status/1194613141432352768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

If you're interested, then please [Email me](mailto:alex@openfaas.com) as soon as possible as the deadline is fast approaching - CFP Close: Wednesday, December 4, 2019.
