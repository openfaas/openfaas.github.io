Learn how the kim tool from Rancher can be used to build functions directly into a K3s cluster

## Introduction

The workflow for building an OpenFaaS function involves creating a container image, pushing it into a registry and then deploying it into a cluster. That cluster could be remote, or running on your own PC, but during development this push and pull phase can cause a significant lag for testing changes.

In this blog post we'll explore how to test out kim, a new project written at Rancher Labs which can build a container image directly into a node's image library. That means that we can shave off several seconds whenever we want to build a new function and deploy it compared to using `faas-cli up` with Docker or buildkit.

There is some prior art here, and Rancher certainly aren't the only ones trying to help. The term "inner-loop" is often used with productivity tools to describe the period between thinking of a change, writing the code and having it deployed onto your cluster.

Prior art:

* [Okteto](https://okteto.com/) - focused on sharing multiple namespaces between teams and providing a live-debug experience.
* [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) - from Google, it deploys containers whenever you hit save
* [tilt](https://tilt.dev/) - similar to skaffold, tilt provides a DSL for defining how to redeploy your code
* [ko](https://github.com/google/ko) - specific to only Golang, ko is another Google project that is designed to deploy Go code to a Kubernetes cluster
* [Garden](https://garden.io/) - opinionated platform for making local development faster through "inner-loop"
* [Live reloading with docker-compose](https://simonemms.com/blog/2020/08/12/live-reload-for-openfaas/) - an approach by Simon Emms to run the function outside of openfaas and reload code live with docker-compose

kim isn't revolutionary here, but it does provide a pragmatic tool that speeds up openfaas function development. Feel free to follow along with me, or try it out for yourself, next time you need to build a function.

> [Arkade](https://get-arkade.dev) is an open source marketplace for Kubernetes and has 40+ apps and 40+ CLIs available for download.

We'll use [arkade 0.7.14](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade/releases/tag/0.7.14) or newer to download the various CLIs we need and to install OpenFaaS. You can of course source these yourself if you prefer to do that for some reason.

## Quickstart

You'll need a Virtual Machine (VM) since kim currently does not work with [K3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d) out of the box.

All commands need to be run on your client, not on the VM. Do not log into the VM, it's unnecessary.

### Create a local VM

You can create a VM on your own computer using [Multipass](https://multipass.run) and Ubuntu.

```bash
multipass launch \
 --cpus 2 \
 --disk 20G \
 --mem 8G \
 --name k3s-kim
```

You can use `multipass exec k3s-kim bash` to add your public SSH key to the `.ssh/authorized_keys` file. Then find the IP using `multipass info`

### Or create a VM in the cloud

Or pick your favourite cloud. [Linode](https://linode.com) is a homepage sponsor for OpenFaaS and a developer cloud. You can get [100 USD of free credit to create VMs for K3s](https://linode.com).

Once you have your VM, install your SSH key if you haven't already:

```bash
export IP=""
ssh-copy-id root@IP
```

### Install K3s with k3sup

The easiest way to get k3sup is via arkade:

```bash
curl -sLS https://get.arkade.dev | sh
sudo mv arkade /usr/local/bin/
```

Followed by:

```bash
arkade get k3sup
```

Then use [k3sup](https://k3sup.dev/) to install K3s:

```bash
# Set the public IP here
export IP=""

k3sup install \
  --ip $IP \
  --user root \
  --k3s-channel latest
```

Once installed you'll have a KUBECONFIG file you can use:

```
export KUBECONFIG=`pwd`/kubeconfig
```

Alternatively, merge the file into your Kubernetes context for permanent use:

```bash
export IP=""
k3sup install \
  --ip $IP \
  --user root \
  --k3s-channel latest \
  --merge \
  --local-file $HOME/.kube/config \
  --context k3s-kim
```

Then download `kubectx` and set your context:

```bash
arkade get kubectx
kubectx k3s-kim
```

### Install OpenFaaS

Install the OpenFaaS CLI:

```bash
arkade get faas-cli
```

Now install OpenFaaS and set the image pull policy for functions to "IfNotPresent", otherwise the approach kim takes will not work.

```bash
arkade install openfaas \
  --set faasnetes.imagePullPolicy=IfNotPresent
```

Run the commands given to you to start port-forwarding the OpenFaaS gateway and to log in. If you forget the commands just type `arkade info openfaas` to get them back again.

### Deploy kim

kim has a server and client component. The server (also known as an agent) needs to be installed.

Download the client from arkade:

```bash
arkade get kim
```

```bash
kim builder install
```

Run `kubectl get pods -n kube-image -w` and you should see the pod created for the build agent.

### Alias docker to kim

The `kim` CLI is similar to `docker`, so the easiest thing we can do to continue using the workflow we know with `faas-cli` is to make kim point at docker.

```bash
sudo mv /usr/local/bin/docker{,2}
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/kim /usr/local/bin/docker

docker --version
kim version v0.1.0-alpha.12 (ac0a8eb3d8801e0e8808b1d6d5303b70c2b3beb0)
```

In a future version of [faas-cli](https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli), we may add a flag to `faas-cli build` such as `--kim` to switch the command from `docker` to this new tool. For the time being, this is a temporary workaround.

Later on, you can restore your Docker CLI with:

```bash
sudo mv /usr/local/bin/docker{2,}
```

### Create a function and deploy it.

```bash
# Fetch the template
faas-cli template store pull node12

# Create a new function
faas-cli new --lang node12 jsbot

# cat ./jsbot/handler.js
```

You'll see the handler as follows:

```js
'use strict'

module.exports = async (event, context) => {
  const result = {
    'body': JSON.stringify(event.body),
    'content-type': event.headers["content-type"]
  }

  return context
    .status(200)
    .succeed(result)
}
```

Now change the code as follows:

```js
'use strict'

module.exports = async (event, context) => {
  return context.status(200).succeed("OK")
}
```

Run:

```bash
faas-cli up -f jsbot.yml --skip-push
```

The `--skip-push` option is required to prevent the image being transferred to a registry and back down again. That's what we're trying to avoid.

Invoke the endpoint:

```bash
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8080/function/jsbot
OK
```

Update the code and run the command again:

```js
'use strict'

module.exports = async (event, context) => {
  return context.status(200).succeed("That was more than just OK!")
}
```

Build an image with kim and deploy it:

```bash
faas-cli up -f jsbot.yml --skip-push
```

Invoke the endpoint:

```bash
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8080/function/jsbot
That was more than just OK!
```

## Wrapping up

In a very short period of time we were able to increase the speed of building openfaas functions for local development. This works with every template and language that you may want to try, and doesn't need a lot of extra steps or for you to learn new concepts.

The kim project is still nascent, and likely to change and improve over time.

These statements are true at time of writing and may change:

* kim doesn't work "out of the box" with [K3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d) and [requires additional configuration](https://twitter.com/dweomer/status/1392207985380757505?s=20)
* I haven't been able to confirm whether it works with Apple M1 yet. The new [Rancher Desktop tool](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rd) that ships with kim built-in does not work with Apple M1
* The `--squash` flag is not yet available in kim
* kim also doesn't work for multi-node setups because it was designed to only accelerate local development

> It should also be noted that kim will not work with [faasd](https://github.com/openfaas/faasd), however if there is enough demand, we could look at creating a similar tool for the community.

Why don't you try it out next time you find yourself building, pushing and pulling down images for OpenFaaS or another application?

> If you've decided that kim is not for you, why don't you try enabling buildkit instead? It's a faster way to build functions and works with both OpenFaaS on Kubernetes and K3d. Just prefix your `faas-cli up` command with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 `, or set it as an environment variable.

### Addendum

[Jacob Christen](https://twitter.com/dweomer) from Rancher sent me these two commands on Twitter. I haven't tested them, so your mileage may vary. They should enable `kim` with k3d / Docker.

For [K3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d):

```bash
k3d cluster create \
  --volume /var/lib/buildkit \
  --volume /var/lib/rancher \
  --volume /tmp
```

For K3s within Docker:

```bash
docker run -it --name k3s --privileged \
--tmpfs /run \
--tmpfs /tmp \
--volume /var/lib/buildkit \
--volume /var/lib/rancher \
rancher/k3s:v1.20.5-k3s1 server --token=k3s
```
