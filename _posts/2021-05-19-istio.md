Learn how to enable Istio for OpenFaaS to take advantage of Mutual TLS and the Istio Gateway

## Introduction

Service meshes have become popular add-ons for Kubernetes, so much so that they have their [own ServiceMeshCon days](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/servicemeshcon/) at [KubeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/), the official Kubernetes conference.

A service mesh can be used to apply policies to network communication, encrypt traffic between endpoints and for advanced routing.

[Istio](https://istio.io) is one of the most popular service meshes available for use with Kubernetes and with help from the team at Google, we've recently updated the support and documentation for using Istio with OpenFaaS.

The value for users is:
* Providing more advanced and flexible policy than Kubernetes' NetworkPolicies
* Encrypting traffic between all OpenFaaS components and functions for "zero trust"
* Providing advanced networking like retries, and weighting for canaries and gradual rollouts of new functions

Thank you to [John Howard](https://github.com/howardjohn) from Google for helping us with this work and to [Lucas Roesler](https://github.com/lucasroesler) for reviewing and testing the work.

In this blog post we'll give you a quick introduction so that you can start integrating Istio with OpenFaaS. We'll then go on to show you how to measure the resource consumption of the cluster, and how to create a TLS certificate for the Istio Gateway.

> There are many service mesh products available. Other popular options include: [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io), [Kuma](https://kuma.io/) and [Consul](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/service-mesh).

## Tutorial

We are using arkade, the open source marketplace to download CLIs and to install the apps we need. You can also do this the hard way if you prefer, just refer to the documentation or the helm chart for more.

### Bootstrap the cluster

Create a local cluster for testing:

```bash
arkade get kind

kind create cluster \
  --name openfaas-istio
```

### Add Istio

Once up and running, install Istio:

```bash
arkade install istio
```

At time of writing this installs Istio 1.9.

### Install OpenFaaS

Now install OpenFaaS using the following changes:

The `gateway.directFunctions=true` flag prevents OpenFaaS from trying to do its own endpoint load-balancing between function replicas, and defers to Envoy instead. Envoy is configured for each pod by Istio and handles routing and retries.

The `istio.mtls` flag is optional, but when set encrypts the traffic between each of the pods in the `openfaas` and `openfaas-fn` namespace.

```bash
arkade install openfaas \
  --set gateway.directFunctions=true \
  --set istio.mtls=true
```

At this point everything is configured and you can use OpenFaaS.

### Access OpenFaaS with an Istio Gateway

Create an Istio Gateway so that we can connect to the OpenFaaS Gateway and log in.

```bash
# gateway.yaml
cat > gateway.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: openfaas-gateway
  namespace: openfaas
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway # use istio default controller
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "*"
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: openfaas-api
  namespace: openfaas
spec:
  hosts:
  - "*"
  gateways:
  - openfaas-gateway
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        prefix: /
    route:
    - destination:
        host: gateway
        port:
          number: 8080
EOF

kubectl apply -f gateway.yaml
```

Port-forward the Istio Ingress Gateway:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n istio-system \
  svc/istio-ingressgateway \
  8080:80 \
  8443:443 &
```

Log in:

```bash
PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret -n openfaas basic-auth -o jsonpath="{.data.basic-auth-password}" | base64 --decode; echo)
echo -n $PASSWORD | faas-cli login --username admin --password-stdin
```

### Deploy a test function

```bash
# Find something you are interested in with:
faas-cli store list

# Deploy one of the functions
faas-cli store deploy nodeinfo
```

Invoke the function via the Istio Ingress gateway:

```bash
echo | faas-cli invoke nodeinfo
```

Describe the Function's deployment, so you can see that the Istio proxy (Envoy) has been configured:

```
kubectl describe pod -n openfaas-fn

You can also use `istioctl` to explore the status of the proxy:

```

```

Running the following will open a dashboard, and you can run `istioctl dashboard --help` to see how to launch the Grafana or Envoy UI.

```bash
istioctl dashboard controlz deployment/istiod.istio-system
```

![Istio controlz dashboard](/images/2021-05-istio/dash.png)
> Istio controlz dashboard

I was also able to verify that the OpenFaaS gateway was receiving encrypted messages. To do this, I reinstalled Istio using [the instructions in the docs](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/mtls-migration/) in privileged mode. Then I restarted the gateway and observed encrypted messages with `tcpdump`:

> Encrypted messages observed with tcpdump

You can detect the presence of Envoy within your function by looking at the HTTP headers passed on:

```bash
faas-cli deploy \
  --name env \
  --image ghcr.io/openfaas/alpine:latest \
  --fprocess="env"

echo | faas-cli invoke env

## Going Further

### Measuring the effects

There is a cost involved with installing a service mesh like Istio. There will be additional RAM required, additional control-plane components to configure and keep updated, along with additional latency and cold-start times for scaling functions from zero.

If you would like to understand the quiescent load on the cluster, you can install the Kubernetes metrics-server through arkade:

```bash
arkade install metrics-server

# Wait a few minutes for data collection, then run:
kubectl top node
kubectl top pod -A
```

These are my results after having completed the whole tutorial including: KinD, cert-manager, openfaas, inlets-operator and the metrics-server itself.

```bash
kubectl top node

```

If this seems like a lot of infrastructure for running a single function, then you may be interested in taking a look at a more minimal stack with [faasd](https://github.com/openfaas/faasd). faasd runs on a single host and makes different tradeoffs so that it requires very minimal resources to run functions.

### Getting a TLS certificate

Let's now get a TLS certificate so that we can serve traffic to clients securely.

First, create a DNS A record for the IP address of the Istio Ingress gateway using your preferred cloud dashboard and DNS service.

```bash
kubectl get svc -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway
NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP
istio-ingressgateway   LoadBalancer   10.106.200.195   <pending>
```
If you're running within a private VPC, on-premises or on your laptop, then you will need to get a public IP for Istio through the inlets-operator. See a full guide to [setting up the inlets-operator with Istio](https://blog.alexellis.io/a-bit-of-istio-before-tea-time/) to provide an IP via a secure tunnel. That will then change `<pending>` to a fully accessible IP.

Otherwise, copy the IP or CNAME issued to you under `EXTERNAL-IP` and create your DNS entry. I'll be using the domain `faas.o6s.io`.

You can get a TLS certificate to serve traffic over HTTPS using cert-manager.

```bash
arkade install cert-manager
```

Now create an `Issuer` and register it with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/):

```bash
export EMAIL="you@example.com"

cat > issuer.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: $EMAIL
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    solvers:
    - selector: {}
      http01:
        ingress:
          class: istio
EOF
kubectl apply -f issuer.yaml
```

Define a certificate:

```bash
export DOMAIN="faas.o6s.io"

cat > cert.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: ingress-cert
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  secretName: ingress-cert
  commonName: $DOMAIN
  dnsNames:
  - $DOMAIN
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt-prod
    kind: Issuer
EOF
kubectl apply -f cert.yaml
```

You can then check the status of the issuer and certificate:

```bash
kubectl get issuer -n istio-system -o wide
NAME               READY   STATUS                                                 AGE
letsencrypt-prod   True    The ACME account was registered with the ACME server   2m22s

kubectl get certificate -n istio-system -o wide
NAME           READY   SECRET         ISSUER             STATUS                                          AGE
ingress-cert   True    ingress-cert   letsencrypt-prod   Certificate is up to date and has not expired   30s
```

Now finally update the IngressGateway we created earlier so that it uses the domain we have defined such as `faas.o6s.io`.

```bash
# gateway.yaml
cat > gateway.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: openfaas-gateway
  namespace: openfaas
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 443
      name: https
      protocol: HTTPS
    tls:
      mode: SIMPLE
      credentialName: ingress-cert
    hosts:
    - faas.o6s.io
EOF

kubectl apply -f gateway.yaml
```

At this point you can log into OpenFaaS via its public URL and access the nodeinfo function:

```bash
export OPENFAAS_URL="https://faas.o6s.io"
echo -n $PASSWORD | faas-cli login --username admin --password-stdin

Calling the OpenFaaS server to validate the credentials...

credentials saved for admin https://faas.o6s.io
```

Invoke the function:

```bash
curl -s -d "" $OPENFAAS_URL/function/nodeinfo
```

> You can also see the certificate if you open your browser

## Wrapping up

In a short period of time we were able to deploy Istio and OpenFaaS on a local KinD cluster and see Envoy's sidecar providing mutual TLS encryption. We then went on to explore the additional resource consumption added by using Istio, and finally showed you how to create a TLS certificate for external traffic using a free certificate from Let's Encrypt.

Istio is feature-rich, with extensive documentation and examples.

I found the FAQ answered many questions I had whilst preparing this tutorial and recommend taking a read: [Istio FAQ](https://istio.io/latest/about/faq/).

A good place to start exploring what is possible, would be the [Task-based section](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/) of the documentation. For instance, you could look into more advanced policies for routing and traffic shifting or partial weighting using [VirtualServices](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/) for individual functions.

> You may also like the workshop we created to show how to do mutual TLS and traffic shifting with [OpenFaaS and Linkerd](https://github.com/openfaas/openfaas-linkerd-workshop).
